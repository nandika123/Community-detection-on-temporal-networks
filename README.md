# Community-detection-on-temporal-networks


The social network represents large real-world directed social graphs.
Detection of communities or clusters from these graphs is a problem of
considerable research interest. In online interactive websites like Facebook, Stack Overflow, Ask Ubuntu,
Bitcoin Alpha, Math Overflow, etc., multiple specific communities can be formed
from multiple users interacting with one another in various kinds.
Community detection is an important area of research in the fields of computer
science, social science etc. 

TEMPORAL NETWORKS
A temporal network, also known as a time-varying network, is a network
whose links are active only at certain points in time. Each link carries
information on when it is active, along with other possible characteristics such
as a weight. 

COMMUNITY DETECTION
Community detection is key to understanding the structure of complex
networks, and ultimately extracting useful information from them.
